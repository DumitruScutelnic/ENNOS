# ENNOS: Enhanced Neural Network For Organoid Segmentation
---
### A deep learning framework that combines a convolutional preprocessing module (ProNet) with a U-Netâ€“based segmentation network. ProNet employs a novel multi- component loss function that integrates pixel-wise (MAE), structural (SSIM), and frequency-domain (Fourier) objectives to standardize image quality and enhance structural detail across diverse imaging conditions. Extensive validation on two independent datasets demonstrates that ENNOS outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy (mAP 98.46%, mIoU 88.57%, mDICE 93.90%) and computational efficiency, while maintaining strong generalizability across different acquisition platforms.

## ENNOS Architecture
The proposed model is a dual-component neural architecture that integrates a
- __Processing Network (ProNet)__: CNN that applies image enhancement operations to the input, producing a refined version optimised for downstream analysis.
- __Segmentation Network__: U-Net architecture that receives the preprocessed image from the processing network and generates the corresponding segmentation mask.
